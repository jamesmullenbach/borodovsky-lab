keeping a file to keep track of the steps to take next
will first try to implement argument parsing
add --noPeaks and --peaksOnly options that vary the processing
else:
going to make a new .py file that parses almost the exact same

TODO:
figure out why the thresholding isn't working
change variance calculation after applying ceiling value
maybe consider preprocessing the coverage file into a dict {start1: score1, ...} format
